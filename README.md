# Lists
This is a GUI menu-based program that supports manipulating the list data structures (1D
arrays and linked lists). It prompts the user to create an array, a 2D array and linked lists.
The user then gets to sort the list, search for a value in the list and add to the list.

#1. The window contains a menu bar with several options: "File," "One Dimensional Array," "Linked List," and "Two Dimensional Array."

2. Explore the different options available in each menu to perform various actions.
      - In the "File" menu, you can select "About" to display information about 
        the program or select "Exit" to close the program.
        
      - In the "One Dimensional Array" menu, you can choose from 
        options like creating an array, calculating array statistics 
        (minimum, maximum, average), sorting the array, and searching 
        for a value in the array.
        
      - In the "Linked List" menu, you can create a linked list, add 
        values to the beginning or end of the list, calculate list statistics
        (minimum, maximum, average), sort the list, and search for a value in the list.
        
      - In the "Two Dimensional Array" menu, you can create a two-dimensional 
        array, calculate array statistics (minimum, maximum, average), and search 
        for a value in the array.

3. Select the desired action from the menu by clicking on the corresponding option.

5. Depending on the selected action, the program may prompt you for additional input through dialog boxes.
      - For example, when creating an array or a linked list, you will 
        be asked to enter integer values.
        
      - When searching for a value, you will be prompted to enter
        the search key.
        
6. After performing the selected action, the program will display the results in the window.
      - For array-related actions, the original array and any modifications 
        will be displayed along with the calculated statistics.
        
      - For linked list-related actions, the original linked list and any 
        modifications will be displayed along with the calculated statistics.
        
      - For search operations, the program will indicate whether the value 
        was found or not.
      
7. You can repeat the above steps to perform different actions or select different options from the menu.

8. To exit the program, you can either select "Exit" from the "File" menu or close the program window.

Note: The program provides visual representation of the arrays and lists, along with the calculated statistics, using graphical elements in the window.
